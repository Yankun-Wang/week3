    <div>Hi there!  I am Yankun Wang.
I’m a UX & Product Designer with a background in Architecture. Currently studying in the first year Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Through my college career, I’ve learned 3 things about myself: I love people, I love solving problems for people, I love solving problems in creative ways.

I believe in working interdisciplinary and collaborative, which helps me develop essential critical thinking skills. My strength and passion lie in creating continuous interactions between digital and physical reality.

Beside working on my projects, I enjoy playing basketball, cooking and playing video games.
