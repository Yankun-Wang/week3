    <h2>Intro</h2><br>
    <p>D-Lens, a interactive information tool that generates fun and exploratory connection solutions for the Midtown Cultural District of Detroit. This is an entrant to the Midtown Cultural Connections Student Design Competition.
What is the role of the art museum and cultural district in the 21st century? How do cultural institutions establish or reflect civic values?</p>

<div class="description"></div>
    <p>As part of the DIA Plaza & Midtown Cultural Connections international design competition, student design teams are invited to envision how these institutions can better serve the community around them.
The Cultural District in Detroit is home to 12 institutions all within walking distance of one another such as the Detroit Public Library, the DIA and Wayne State University. The issue they face is connecting visitors to the district and the institutions within it.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2><br>

    <p>If a visitor goes to the Cultural District for a certain destination, how do we create an exploratory experience during his/her walk to the destination, how to overcome the knowledge gap of cultural district users through exploratory interaction.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>Findings</h2><br>
    <p>Most users come to the Cultural District with a specific goal in mind; the user journey is focused and not necessarily concerned with other district opportunities. There is no centralized source of information for the Cultural District as a whole. Most exhibits are out of public view & within the walls of institutions, creating a knowledge gap. The opportunity for information attainment is during the short journey from point of entry to a destination.
